# `@newscorp-ghfb/wsj-react-library`

Library of functional React components (built as [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/docs)) that implements the _WSJ_ design system. FKA `dj-milford`.

## Important Links

- See [`dj-rendering README`](https://github.com/newscorp-ghfb/dj-rendering#dj-rendering)

## Setup

`@newscorp-ghfb/wsj-react-library` is published as a private GitHub package, and so you will need to authenticate with a token in order to install.

- [Generate a Personal Access Token and Enable SSO Access](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)
  - Add the permissions `read:package` and `repo`
  - Make sure `Enable SSO` is turned ON, click on authorize (You will need to do this even if you are updating the scope of an existing Token).
- [Log in to npm using the Token you generated](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-packages#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token)
- Add this to your `~/.npmrc` file: `@newscorp-ghfb:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com`

### Running locally

Once you're in `dj-rendering/packages/wsj-react-library`:

```bash
yarn start
```

### To enable SSL & make external network calls (required for some components, such as the `<SaveButton />`) âœ…

- Ensure you have HTTPS set up locally [(instructions here)](https://github.dowjones.net/responsive/local-consumer-ssl-certs) and your `hosts` file contains `127.0.0.1 www.local.wsj.com`
- Global Protect VPN must be on
- Be logged in to www.s.dev.wsj.com in the same session to leverage the `djcs_session` cookie in the requests
- run `yarn start --https --ssl-cert=$HOME/.consumer-certs/consumer.crt --ssl-key=$HOME/.consumer-certs/consumer.key`
  - `$HOME` is an envvar for bash and other \*nix systems. Use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) on Windows.

### Install

Once you're authenticated, simply install like any other node module:

```bash
yarn add --dev @newscorp-ghfb/wsj-react-library
```

Or if your project uses `npm`:

```bash
npm i @newscorp-ghfb/wsj-react-library --save
```

You must also install `styled-components`, `react`, and `react-dom` in your app. They're all `peerDependencies`.

```bash
yarn add styled-components react react-dom
```

## Usage

```js
import { Button } from '@newscorp-ghfb/wsj-react-library';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        <Button primary>Now Go Make Something</Button>
      </p>
      <p>
        <Button secondary>Now Go Make Something Secondary</Button>
      </p>
      <p>
        <Button tertiary>Now Go Make Something Tertiary</Button>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Server Side Rendering

Styled Components offers a few utilities for enabling server side rendering. If you're working with `nextjs`, follow the directions [here](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#nextjs).

There are docs for other frameworks at that link as well.

## Developing

```bash
git clone git@github.com:newscorp-ghfb/dj-rendering.git
cd dj-rendering
yarn
cd packages/wsj-react-library
yarn start
```

This will boot up a storybook development environment for you.

### `nvm`

If you use [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), you can run `nvm use` to switch to the version of node specified in [`.nvmrc`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#nvmrc).

### Local Development

Read more in the [local development guide](./docs/local-development.md).

## Tests

```bash
yarn test
```

## Distributing

`@newscorp-ghfb/wsj-react-library` is distributed as commonjs (node) and ecmascript modules. The component source is transpiled to es5 and can be tree-shaken from the app's final bundle.

Additionally, storybook stories are shipped to our Design System Manager (DSM) interface where they can be seen with the original design artifacts.

### Versioning

New versions are distributed by the [monorepo using `lerna`](https://github.com/newscorp-ghfb/dj-rendering#cicd-process).

### Updating DSM

See the [DSM guide](./docs/DSM.md).
