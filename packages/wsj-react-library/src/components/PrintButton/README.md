# Print Button - Article Tools

## Default Behavior

The Print Button opens the browser's print dialog to print the current article.

## Implementation

The Print Button should render as part of the Article Tools implemented within an article layout. In standard articles, the Print Button should only display on browser screens that are 980px or wider. It should be the first tool item displayed if a user is logged out, second if a user is logged in.
